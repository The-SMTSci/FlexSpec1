<p>When handling optics uses gloves, nitrile or pure clean untreated
cotton gloves. This will protect the optical elements and protect
you from harsh cleaning chemicals. Optics should be stored in an
airtight container to avoid reaction with pollutants.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Never</strong> use silcone based adhesives or silicone based lubricants any
where near optics. They outgas and condense on the optical surfaces.</p></li>
<li><p>The optics should never be touched with your bare hands.  Always
use clean powder free latex or nitrile gloves. Finger prints leave
oils, acids and other volatiles on the surfaces which in the cases of
gratings can not be removed. On lenses or mirrors they may etch the
surface coatings.</p></li>
<li><p>If after careful handling a finger print gets on the surface a
micro fiber cloth may remove it if used gently.  DON’T try to wipe a
grating it will scratch.</p></li>
<li><p>Front surface mirrors are also fragile. Usually they are over
coated for protection but the coating may be very thin.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t use <strong>Windex</strong> ® to clean optics. It contains ammonia which
can remove aluminum coating. Use Everclear ® grain alcohol, 95%
ethanol alcohol or commercial lens cleaning solution as a cleaning
fluid. Us it sparingly. Grain alcohol does not contain denaturing
agents and should not leave a fine white powder on optics.</p>
<p>Like most alcohols, isopropyl alcohol reacts with active metals
such as potassium to form alkoxides that can be called
isopropoxides. The reaction with aluminum (initiated by a trace
of mercury) is used to prepare the catalyst aluminum
isopropoxides. Most IPA isopropyl alcohol has denaturing
agents added and will leave a fine white powder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gratings are very susceptible to handling problems. Even with
gloves never touch the ruled surface.  Any scratches or finger prints
will introduce scattered light in to the system. A spectrograph is
always starved for light and to scatter some of the light will reduce
the throughput.</p></li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Grating orientation: if a commercial blazed grating is used it
will have an arrow drawn on the top, bottom or both edges that are
perpendicular to the grooves.  This arrow shows the blaze
direction. The arrow should point toward the incoming beam.  This
orientation maximizes the energy into the first order. If the
arrow is missing it is possible to look into the spectrographs
camera port, without the camera lens in place, while light is
shinning on the slit, rotate the grating so that the zero’th order
can be seen. Then rotate the grating further to pick up the
spectrum starting with the blue end. Further grating rotation will
the bring up the second order. The first order should be very much
brighter than the second order.  If it isn’t the grating
orientation in the holder should be reversed.</p></li>
<li><p>If the dispersion along the image from the sensor is not
horizontal (follows a ‘row’ of pixels), the camera needs to be
rotated such that it is.</p></li>
<li><p>If the calibration lamp emission lines are not vertical with
respect to the grating; the OVIO slit needs to be rotated in it’s
holder to make them vertical. This can be fiddly sometimes to get
right. Also the vertical slit must be co-linear with the grating
grooves.</p></li>
<li><p>If lenses are not a snug fit into their holders a small
application of white glue on the holder will hold them in place
but allow later removal if needed. Don’t get a glue string on the
lens.</p></li>
<li><p>If the lens is a snug fit into the holder make sure that you don’t
apply too much pressure to insert it. Some lower quality achromat
lens elements are not glued in a way that is precisely centered
and while pushing it in an edge might get caught and split the
elements apart.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on many factors (lens focal length, aperture, quality)
the blue and red ends of the spectra may be out of focus while the
center is sharp. This is normal with simple achromat lenses used
for the camera lens. If a commercial photographic lens is used for
the camera lens this is much less of a problem as the multiple
elements in the commercial lens are designed to flatten the field.</p></li>
<li><p>When combined with large chips, short focal length lenses, with
short radii may require the sensors plane to be shifted. This is
easily achieved with after-marked sensor/camera tilt correctors.</p></li>
<li><p>A Cheshire eyepiece (laser collimator) is a very handy tool to get
things lined up in the spectrograph, particularly the guide mirror
and main mirror. It is also an easy way to check if the grating is
mounted with it’s surface parallel with the rotation stage. If it
is a green laser and the grating stage rotated till the beam is
centered in the camera port, then the first spectra will be close
to centered. If red then adjust the grating angle such that it is
where H-alpha emission is expected on the image.</p></li>
<li><p>Achromat lens orientation. When mounting lenses the side with the
bigger “bulge” should be oriented toward the grating. Both for the
collimating lens as well as the camera lens.</p></li>
