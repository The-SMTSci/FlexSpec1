Optical Experiments
===================

There are several optical experiments to consider.

#. Orientation of grating.

#. Focus of the camera/collimator.



Orientation of Grating
-----------------------

Commercial spectrographs have been received with the grating
facing the wrong way. This is a simple experiment to determine
the direction of the blazed order:

Materials:

#. A dimmer laser pointer.

#. A simple littrow prism from Surplus Shed. (L2003D) or a Herschel wedge
solar 'filter'.

#. White Index Card

Open the spectrograph just enough to insert the card, and shine the laser beam
onto the grating. The angle is not that important for this test a large angle
will be OK -- as long as it is not too large.

The littrow prism/Herschel wedge reduces the laser brightness by about 95 percent.
If the laser pointer is very dim, it is not needed.

Place a white card to receive the reflection of a dim laser beam. The brightest
dot is the specular reflection (non-dispersed order-0 beam). The brightest
spot will be the 'blazed' beam. This is most often the +1 order. On rare
occasions (surplus gratings for example) may have the blaze set to a different
order.


Focus of the Camera/Collimator
------------------------------

In order to achieve and maintain accurate collimation to and from
the grating we find that focusing the science camera on infinity at the 
outset and solely focusing the collimationg mirror during operation 
results in the best possible set up.  This may seem obvious but most 
commercial spectrographs allow the user to change the science camera 
focus during an observing session (because the collimating mirror is 
usually inaccessible).  This may be necessary because of thermal 
changes or flexure in the spectrograph body.  The result is 
a badly collimated system.

We suggest the following method of set up.

Position a camera (a DSLR will work) with its lens focused for
infinity using a very distant point source. A far away
street-light or a bright star works. Most commercial camera
lenses will focus IR light, hence the full stop is NOT
focused for visible light.

Place a front surface mirror at the grating position, and the camera
at the exit 'camera' port of the spectrograph. Then focus the slit's
image using the collimating mirror. This is a 'real' close 
approximation for the collimator lens focus.

The FlexSpec has a remote collimating mirror adjuster driven by
a stepper motor and eccentri cam arrangement for fine focus during
an observing session.  This means the FlexSpec can be focused 
without touching.

Future FlexSpec will have a remote-selectable grating changer. Plans
are to include a front-surface mirror.
