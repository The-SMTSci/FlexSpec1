Download FlexSpec1 Files
========================

FlexSpec1 is managed and distributed using the super zip-like
\*cough\* environment managed by the free **git** source code management (SCM)
system. Git will manage anything, not just computer code. So, we use
it! We distribute the STL files, and their original package's
sources. SLDPRT for Solidworks for example. We also distribute code
for the Raspberry Pi, Arduinos, documentation, python utilities.  We
greatly appreciate SolidWorks support of community education projects.
We use KiCAD (pronounced "Kee CAD") for EDA (Electronic Design
Automation) schematics. We may use other CAD programs to make
files. FreeCad is the latest adventure. Our general rule is to use
free or accessible software so everyone may participate. This means
any age, anywhere, anytime.

We are sharing a working dynamic release of the files and
documentation we develop for ourselves. Our files are your files. We
use the MIT license. This license boils down to copy-center. Take our
stuff to the copy-center and make all the copies you want. You can not
claim our work or limit our ownership. We can offer to share with you
and we do so freely. See the license for the liability statements etc.

**OK I want to build a spectrograph.**

.. code:: bash

    # Use PowerShell for Windows:
    mkdir C:\git
    cd C:\git
    git clone https://github.com/dxwayne/FlexSpec1

Or with **linux**:

.. code:: bash

    # Use bash for Mac/Linux
    mkdir $HOME/git
    cd $HOME/git
    git clone https://github.com/dxwayne/FlexSpec1

TaDa you have what we have. 

**What did I get into?**

Under FlexSpec1/docs/source you find a bunch of .rst files. These
are used to make our `readthedocs.io files <https://flexspec1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
site. **Read All About It**.

In the lower-right of the page, you should find a little box:
"v:latest". Hit that little down-caret and you can get a PDF.

This documentation is made with Sphinx documentation management, coordinated
with shared credentials with readthedocs.io.
