**Abstract**: 
This final paper of the FlexSpec1 series presents lessons learned and applied to 3D-Printed/Hybrid spectrographs for small telescope science. We present a detailed analysis of the photon-path from source to sensor and the steps within the spectrograph to mitigate instrumentation issues.  We present the caliberation unit, the "Kzin" ring, as a stand-alone aspect of the project suited to all spectrographs. A full implementation is in the puiblic domain via Github. Public documentation is available via ReadTheDocs.io. The full design is available via GitHub, the documentation is at 'readthedocs.io flexspec1 <https://flexspec1.readthedocs.io/en/latest>_.
