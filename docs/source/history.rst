During the AAVSO meeting in Flagstaff, AZ. 16-17 November 2018 -- Cary
Chleborad, Eric Dose, Wayne Green, Michael Lundquist, Tony Rodda
Forrest Sims took an interest into Tony's 3D printing of a
spectrograph.

The Sacramento Mountian Spectroscopy Workshop II, held in Las Curzes
NM on 22-24 February, 2019. At the meeting, Jerry Foote, Wayne Green,
Michael Lundquist, Forrest Sims, Tom Smith agreed it was time to print
the Lowspec improve things.  Clarke Yeager and Greg Jones joined
later.

To this end, the FlexSpec-1 was born. 

We started with first principles and have redesigned several aspects
of current small spectroscope offerings. We are using the
counterposing aspects of a aluminum/steel chassis to fix flexure,
opacity and thermal expansion. 3D printing has proved viable for the
comparatively tiny components supporting the optics within this
chassis. Our software deployment does not require end-user
installation of any programs.  Operations are possible from anywhere
in netdom. We are rather proud of our guide improvements, Fraunhofer
baffle, focusable collimator, Kzin ring calibration and general
automation.

A complete discussion of the work may be found in the Proceedings
of the Society for Astronomical Sciences, 2020, 2021 and 2022.
