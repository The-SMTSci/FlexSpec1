========

Spectroscope - A device that renders a spectrum visible (scopy) and recordable.

Spectrograph - A device that captures a record of a spectrum.

Spectrometer - A device that measures energy over a small interval, like a monochronometer.

Collimating Lens - The lens that renders polychromatic light from the slit into a parallel (collimated) beam.

Camera Lens - (Sometime called objective lens) the lens that converts the non-collimated beam from the grating from phase space to image space.

Grating - A ruled piece of glass that creates the spectrum based on principles of diffraction. 

Beam - a separate pathway for rays through a spectrograph. The pathway's instrument profile differs between beams.

Trace - the dispersion path of light from a minimum to maxium wavelength. 

FWHM - Full Width Half Maximum, taken at 0.5 of the amplitude of a bi-symmetric waveform. 

Airy Disc - a bi-symmetric curve that has :math:`\theta_{FWHM} = 1.025 \frac{\lambda}{d}`. This is larger than a Gaussian FWHM measure. The Gaussian underestimates light distribution at the focal plane.
