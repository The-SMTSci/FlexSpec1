Clarke Yeager, used KiCad [Kicad-1]_ to create the schematic and layout for
several Printed Circuit Boards, emailed to China, made -- with silk
screen overlays and returned. The total cost was around 0.50USD per
board, shipping was more than the costs of the boards. This package
was emailed to Tony Rodda in England where he originated his own
order. Shipping time in Europe was less than for Clarke in the US.
