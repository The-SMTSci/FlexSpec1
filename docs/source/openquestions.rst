Open Questions
==============

This is a very fluid section. Open questions are addressed here.

9 June 2021 Tony Rodda reported the fact that shifting the focus of
a commercial (Pentax) lens between he optical infinity mark and the
little 'dot' representing the infinity focus for infrared, the focus
changed over the dispersion axis.

**First and foremost:** we already know using a parabolic mirror as
a collimating lens is the best approach. The camera lens is
an expedient way to form the image.

This traces back to the fact that an achromat is balanced for two
of the Fraunhofer bands. An Apochromat is balanced for three. Lens
are basically prisms and focus is a function of wavelength. 

**We determined**: The normal for the camera lens has to be tilted
a very small amount to compensate for spectral focus shift across
the dispersion axis projected onto the sensor. 

**We note**: most inexpensive cameras do not maintain enough simple
quality control to make the sensor normal to the optical axis. Since
after-market measures are needed to compensate for the tilt, might
as well "feature it". The difference between a "Bug" and a "Feature"
is the necktie!

The use of a commercial camera lens also helps in achieving a 
flatter field for the science camera (which then improves
calibration) and assists greatly with maintaining overall
collimation.
