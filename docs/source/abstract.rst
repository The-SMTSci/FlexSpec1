**Abstract**: Here we present the engineering and science case for the
Flexible Spectrograph Small Telescope Spectrograph I (FS1).  In Paper
I, we explored 3D Printing the LOWSPEC 1 for general science use. In
Paper II, we presented technical issues and solutions related to the
LOWSPEC 2.  Here, in Paper III, we address the underlying optics and
astrophysics by adding flexibility in choices of materials,
resolutions and optics needed to match observing needs and
capabilities of the community.  The full design is available via
GitHub, the documentation is at 'readthedocs.io flexspec1 <https://flexspec1.readthedocs.io/en/latest>_.

Abstract: Here we present the engineering and science case for the
Flexible Spectrograph Small Telescope Spectrograph I (FlexSpec1).  In Paper
I, we explored the 3D printing of the LOWSPEC 1 for general science
use. In Paper II, we presented technical issues and solutions related
to the LOWSPEC 2.  Here, in Paper III, we take the general design one
step further by addressing the underlying optics and physics. We add
flexibility through choices of materials, resolutions and optics
needed to match observing needs and capabilities related to small
telescope spectroscopy. We lay the foundation for remote operation of
the instrument. The full design will be available via GitHUB, the
documentation is at flexspec1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
