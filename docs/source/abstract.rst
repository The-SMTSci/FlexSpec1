**Abstract**: Here we present the engineering and science case for the
Flexible Spectrograph Small Telescope Spectrograph I (FS1).  In Paper
I, we explored 3D Printing the LOWSPEC 1 for general science use. In
Paper II, we presented technical issues and solutions related to the
LOWSPEC 2.  Here, in Paper III, we address the underlying optics and
astrophysics by adding flexibility in choices of materials,
resolutions and optics needed to match observing needs and
capabilities of the community.  The full design is available via
GitHub, the documentation is at 'readthedocs.io flexspec1 <https://flexspec1.readthedocs.io/en/latest>_.
