Optical Experiments
===================

There are several optical experiments to consider.

#. Orientation of grating.

#. Focus of the camera/collimator.



Orientation of Grating
-----------------------

Commercial spectrographs have been received with the grating
facing the wrong way. This is a simple experiment to determine
the direction of the blazed order:

Materials:

#. A dimmer laser pointer.

#. A simple littrow prism from Surplus Shed. (L2003D) or a Herschel wedge
solar 'filter'.

#. White Index Card

Open the spectrograph just enough to insert the card, and shine the laser beam
onto the grating. The angle is not that important for this test a large angle
will be OK -- as long as it is not too large.

The littrow prism/Herschel wedge reduces the laser brightness by about 95 percent.
If the laser pointer is very dim, it is not needed.

Place a white card to receive the reflection of a dim laser beam. The brightest
dot is the specular reflection (non-dispersed order-0 beam). The brightest
spot will be the 'blazed' beam. This is most often the +1 order. On rare
occasions (surplus gratings for example) may have the blaze set to a different
order.


Focus of the Camera/Collimator
------------------------------

Position a camera (DSLR will work) with its lens focused for
infinity using a very distant point source. A far away
street-light or a bright star works. Most commercial camera
lenses will focus IR light, hence the fill stop is NOT
focused for visible light.

Place a front surface mirror at the grating position, and the camera
at the exit 'camera' port of the spectrograph. Then focus the slit's
image. This is a 'real' close approximation for the collimator lens
focus.


Future FlexSpec will have a remote-selectable grating changer. Plans
are to include a front-surface mirror.
