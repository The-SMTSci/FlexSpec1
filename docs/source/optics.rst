Care of Optics
==============

When handling optics uses gloves, nitrile or pure clean untreated
cotton gloves. This will protect the optical elements and protect
you from harsh cleaning chemicals. Optics should be stored in an
airtight container to avoid reaction with pollutants. 

#.  **Never** use silcone based adhesives or silicone based lubricants any 
    where near optics. They outgas and condense on the optical surfaces.

#.  The optics should never be touched with your bare hands.  Always
    use clean powder free latex or nitrile gloves. Finger prints leave
    oils, acids and other volatiles on the surfaces which in the cases of
    gratings can not be removed. On lenses or mirrors they may etch the
    surface coatings.

#.  If after careful handling a finger print gets on the surface a
    micro fiber cloth may remove it if used gently.  DON’T try to wipe a
    grating it will scratch.

#.  Front surface mirrors are also fragile. Usually they are over
    coated for protection but the coating may be very thin.

#.  Don’t use **Windex** |reg| to clean optics. It contains ammonia which
    can remove aluminum coating. Use Everclear |reg| grain alcohol, 95%
    ethanol alcohol or commercial lens cleaning solution as a cleaning
    fluid. Us it sparingly. Grain alcohol does not contain denaturing
    agents and should not leave a fine white powder on optics.

    Like most alcohols, isopropyl alcohol reacts with active metals
    such as potassium to form alkoxides that can be called
    isopropoxides. The reaction with aluminum (initiated by a trace
    of mercury) is used to prepare the catalyst aluminum
    isopropoxides. Most IPA isopropyl alcohol has denaturing
    agents added and will leave a fine white powder.

#.  Gratings are very susceptible to handling problems. Even with
    gloves never touch the ruled surface.  Any scratches or finger prints
    will introduce scattered light in to the system. A spectrograph is
    always starved for light and to scatter some of the light will reduce
    the throughput.

Tips for optics in a spectrograph
---------------------------------

#.  Grating orientation: if a commercial blazed grating is used it
    will have an arrow drawn on the top, bottom or both edges that are
    perpendicular to the grooves.  This arrow shows the blaze
    direction. The arrow should point toward the incoming beam.  This
    orientation maximizes the energy into the first order. If the
    arrow is missing it is possible to look into the spectrographs
    camera port, without the camera lens in place, while light is
    shinning on the slit, rotate the grating so that the zero’th order
    can be seen. Then rotate the grating further to pick up the
    spectrum starting with the blue end. Further grating rotation will
    the bring up the second order. The first order should be very much
    brighter than the second order.  If it isn’t the grating
    orientation in the holder should be reversed.

#.  If the dispersion along the image from the sensor is not
    horizontal (follows a 'row' of pixels), the camera needs to be
    rotated such that it is. 

#.  If the calibration lamp emission lines are not vertical with
    respect to the grating; the OVIO slit needs to be rotated in it’s
    holder to make them vertical. This can be fiddly sometimes to get
    right. Also the vertical slit must be co-linear with the grating
    grooves.

#.  If lenses are not a snug fit into their holders a small
    application of white glue on the holder will hold them in place
    but allow later removal if needed. Don’t get a glue string on the
    lens.

#.  If the lens is a snug fit into the holder make sure that you don’t
    apply too much pressure to insert it. Some lower quality achromat
    lens elements are not glued in a way that is precisely centered
    and while pushing it in an edge might get caught and split the
    elements apart.

#.  Depending on many factors (lens focal length, aperture, quality)
    the blue and red ends of the spectra may be out of focus while the
    center is sharp. This is normal with simple achromat lenses used
    for the camera lens. If a commercial photographic lens is used for
    the camera lens this is much less of a problem as the multiple
    elements in the commercial lens are designed to flatten the field.

#.  When combined with large chips, short focal length lenses, with
    short radii may require the sensors plane to be shifted. This is
    easily achieved with after-marked sensor/camera tilt correctors.

#.  A Cheshire eyepiece (laser collimator) is a very handy tool to get
    things lined up in the spectrograph, particularly the guide mirror
    and main mirror. It is also an easy way to check if the grating is
    mounted with it’s surface parallel with the rotation stage. If it
    is a green laser and the grating stage rotated till the beam is
    centered in the camera port, then the first spectra will be close
    to centered. If red then adjust the grating angle such that it is
    where H-alpha emission is expected on the image.

#.  Achromat lens orientation. When mounting lenses the side with the
    bigger “bulge” should be oriented toward the grating. Both for the
    collimating lens as well as the camera lens.
