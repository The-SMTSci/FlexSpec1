Calibration Lamps
******************

Take reference calibration images, and maintain an archive and a PDF
of graphs of results. You may note changes, and account for
variations that will occur overtime.


Kzin :index:`Kzin` ring [Niven-Ellis]_ is the name assigned to our "ring-like"
in-line passive dispersing element equally illuminated by NeAr lamps,
LEDs, and small incandescent grain-of-wheat bulbs. The ring is shaped
in a way to reside inside the 2-inch nose-piece area outside of the
main housing of Flex Spec 1 (and other spectrographs) as not to take up valuable back-focus area
for popular SCTs. The permanent position of the Kzin ring means
repeatability in injecting the calibration source-light into the
spectrograph.

It has its own Arduino :index:`Kzin;Arduino`, and is controlled by a
series of software switches tied to the main functions. The new 2023 board now
uses Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to adjust each lamp's (except the NeAr lamp) output level.
