Hey,

I am working on a set of notes. I tried to get X11 and IRAF runnning
in a docker container. Big Fail(tm). I dug into making interfaces
using REST and WEBApp tech -- in a container -- on a webhotel.

Some GUI stuff works, and it now may work better.  There was a tonne
of docker internal arcanae I needed to know, learned some, and with
the help from some wizards -- we never figured out the problem. As it
was so tedious I dropped the effort -- it was designed to make an
older macbook run IRAF for a professor. Nothing beats learning how to
get mice from the barn like taking on elephant hunting.

For Django: --- Here, Corey Schafer, describes putting together a
simple blog app- down to the nuts and bolts. The app is real easy and
the django is pretty easy too.

The database stuff is wrapped up in django managed 'migrations'.
PostgreSQL (a docker container itself!) is a ORM -- a
Object/Relational Model database.

Corey Schafer Great Django overview, see 

git clone https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets.git

Lots of good stuff appears to be in this guy's repo.

Practical steps: Start with something that mostly runs, related
to astronomy: Astrometry.net. A real easy way is down below.

Download and play with the Astrometry.net framework. Dockers are
containers for 'server' side deployment (RPi/Astroberry is our
'server side'!).

1) Get a docker account (free) https://hub.docker.com/
2) Download the docker desktop for Win10 or Linux (whatev)
3) clone https://github.com/dstndstn/astrometry.net.git
4) peek into the 'net' directory. That is a django app
   more or less. Some missing bits.

As you know, I work command-line under Linux; and I am venturing
into Win10. I do have docker running in Win10, low milage.

As for the database, it is taken care of by a django concept called
'migrations'. This cuts the code from the underlying DB. You can test
with sqlite and deploy on enterprise PostgreSQL. Django uses the
python manage.py migrations' command-script that does the
'migrations'. There is some bother to brew that up -- this is where
the stuff wanted by django meets the stuff needed for you purpose.

A few of my personal definitions:

PMachine (the machine I can touch 'Physical Machine'

CMachine (the code that thinks it is a pmachine but is a CMachine
  a 'Container Machine'. The PMachine and CMachine keeps me
  sane when thinking about what is what. They are essentially
  indistinguishable at the prompt.

I've attached my docker.aliases file for Linux.
easy to type commands for longwinded docker image blah....

I don't have a decent youtube I can recommend for docker -- I cut my
teeth on docker about 2 years ago. Advantages are:

1) it can make a 'virtual' machine (sans GUI Capability for the most part)
2) you can really mangle the CMachine in that machine and then kill it
   and remake with lessons learned.
Disadvantages:
A) IPSec is a basterd
B) Be real careful accepting docker pull images -- they are known
   to be Evil(tm).
C) A few little things can bog you down until a wizard helps. I have
   some magic -- and my real wizard has 4 new birds heading for orbit
   and is a bit saturated right now! His first time with new birds.

Real easy test: Get astropy running in a container. A two line Dockerfile
    from continuumio/anaconda3:latest
    CMD  /bin/bash


mkdir a directory somewhere, say ~/play/playpen
cd ~/play/playpen
Whip up a Dockerfile (capital D, no extension)
I have one that greatly extends a 'working' base for all sorts
of programs. For AN base -> solver and webservice. It brings
in a compiler, vi the editor, a python together with fitsio
etc.

Another one is continuumio/anaconda3:latest

A cut/paste from a terminal window.

Viola! note astropy.io.fits.open!

Oh ifrinn! Kill that:

 1993  docker ps -a
 1994  docker rm -f 5ccd081540e4
 1995  docker ps -a
 1996  dils
 1997  docker rmi -f 16e9145a4ad0

 1993  - see what containers are 'active' (same as unix ps)
 1994 Note the unique container id5ccd081540e4 ...
 1995 ...  docker rm -f 5ccd081540e4 remove it!
 1996 dils my alias to make long list of images ...
 1997 ... docker rmi -f 16e9145a4ad0 to remove that 'image'

Now all is as it was before.
So all the cruft that may have been loaded was never intertwined
within my PMachine.
